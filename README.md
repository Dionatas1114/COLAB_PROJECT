## Report

In the development of this project, I Was able to gain more experience with the library that 
I usually use (Material UI) and practice writing with TypeScript. 
I felt a bit of difficulty because there was little data to consume, so I Had to use creative. 
Besides, I Tried to implement the bottom bar, but there was only time to create it.
